# Insights-Pop-Song-Structures

Our project looks to determine if the features of a pop song have an impact on whether it will be in the top 50 billboard charts or not. We found it intriguing how songs use a variety of structure sets so we decided to use characteristic of song structures as our main features. This decision also fit with our interest in creating our own dataset as structures are not a commonly considered characteristic during song rank prediction which forced us to form a dataset from the ground up. We used two models, a logistic regression and a multi layered neural network, to determine if structure related features have an impact on a pop song being in the top 50. Both models yielded a roughly 80% accuracy. Though we didn't take into other features(artist popularity, record label, etc), this project provided an interesting insight into what "formula" successful songs in the top 50 use.
